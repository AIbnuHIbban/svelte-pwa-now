Svelte PWA Now starter
=============
A simple Svelte starter template with:
* Tailwind CSS (from [https://github.com/marcograhl/tailwindcss-svelte-starter](https://github.com/marcograhl/tailwindcss-svelte-starter))
* Rollup copy assets plugin to serve static folders (eg. data or images)
* Now integration
* PWA ready, including basic service worker and social sharing meta data boilerplate

## Getting started
Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed. Clone the repo and
```bash
npm install
```

Start by
```bash
npm run dev
```
and go to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

Build for production using
```bash
npm run build
```
and serve the `dist` folder.

## Details
### Tailwind
Find out more about Tailwind CSS [here](https://tailwindcss.com). To extend Tailwind classes, go to ```tailwind.config.js``` and put in your customizations as an object under ```extend ```.

```bash
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        backgroundColor: "#f6f5f5",
        primaryColor: "#5bd1d7",
        secondaryColor: "#248ea9",
        accentColor: "#556fb5"
      }
    }
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: []
};
```
For example, the template comes with custom colors which can then be used in html like ```<div class="backgroundColor"></div>```.

More details can be found [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).

### Now integration
The template includes optional integration with the [Now hosting service](https://zeit.co/now). The easiest way to get started is to link your Github repo to Now, which allows all pushes to be built and served automatically. The included ```now.json``` tells Now to automatically run the rollup build command (via ```package.json```) and serve the ```dist``` folder. 

If applicable, be sure to include your custom web domain under ```alias``` to tell Now to automatically alias your output to your domain.

```bash
{
  "version": 2,
  "alias": "https://ADD-DOMAIN-NAME-HERE",
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@now/static-build"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "headers": { "cache-control": "max-age=0,must-revalidate" },
      "dest": "dist/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

There is also a ```.nowignore``` file which tells Now to ignore specified files, similar to ```.gitignore```.

If you do not need Now integration, feel free to remove ```now.json``` and ```.nowignore```.

### Rollup copy assets plugin
By default, Rollup does not copy static folders to ```dist``` when building. If you have folders with static assets like data files or images, put the folder path in ```rollup.config.js``` like so.

```bash
...
import copy from "rollup-plugin-copy-assets";

const production = !process.env.ROLLUP_WATCH;
export default {
  ...
  plugins: [
    ...
    copy({
      assets: ["src/assets", "src/MORE-STATIC-FOLDERS"]
    }),
    ...
  ]
  ...
};
```

### PWA boilerplate
#### Icons
The commonly required icons are at ```src/assets```. Be sure to use the same filenames as they are referred to in the metadata at ```dist/index.html```. Tip: Use [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) which automatically creates all the required icon sizes, and simply unzip the generated asset bundle into ```src/assets```.

#### index.html metadata
The icons are all utilized in the ```<meta></meta>``` tags for Facebook, Twitter and Google indexing among others. Be sure to customize your app title and descriptions in all the tags.

#### Service worker
This template includes a basic service worker at ```dist/service-worker.js``` which simply checks against the currently held cache and loads from network if required. Feel free to further customize it for your needs.

#### Manifest
Customize ```dist/manifest.json``` with your PWA's info for installation. Note that the manifest requires a 512x512 icon which is not generated by [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). You have to manually create that one on your own.
